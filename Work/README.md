# Work Area

Do all of your coding work here, in the `Work/` directory.  A number of starting
files have been given (`bounce.py`, `mortgage.py`, `pcost.py`, etc.) along with
their corresponding exercise number.

Many of the programs you write reference files found in the `Data/` directory.
That is also located here.

## My additions 

In some cases I want to work ahead, or experiment, on the code used in the exercises. In those cases my diverging version will be in a renamed file (and possibly a different branch if I can keep it up)
